number are positve and negative 
-3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 

number which are in the in the whole form are called real numbers 

numbers are used to calculate the positions which can be in any form 

distance(a,b)
when we need to calculate the distance from one object to another we use distance method which is ussualy calculating the distance between 2 variables
its not neccassary we calculate the distance only in 2d but it can be in 3d also where we have more than 2 variables and each variable can have more than one distance

its more of matrix subtraction bu each matrix array contains the numbers length

-- euclidian distance
